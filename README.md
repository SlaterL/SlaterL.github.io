1) Font: Calabri
2) My portrait uses a table to be inline with my name. I also added a border to the image.
3) The gradient background uses a fixed position so it does not scroll with the rest of the page
4, 7) There is a nav menu on the right side of the page that uses a fixed position. It highlights when you hover over parts of it and
will auto-scroll to a part of the page when clicked.
9) The document is centered over a background that is fixed.
12) Table columns are striped (I felt it looked better with my schedule than striped table rows did)
